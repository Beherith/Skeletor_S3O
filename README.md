# Skeletor_S3O
A blender script that automatically generates a skeleton for an s3o imported model for SpringRTS animation

Usage:
1. import the s3o model with https://github.com/sanguinariojoe/blender_s3o_import

2. Register the script with blender 2.80+ 

3. Go into object mode and select any part of the imported model

4. Press the "Correctly rotate S3O" button, OR rotate the model around 90 degrees, so that Z is up, make sure its feet are on the ground, and apply rotation to ALL pieces, and apply the translation to the base piece only!

5. Press the "Create Skeleton" button

6. You can now go into Pose mode and flail the appendages around. 

7. If inverse kinematics is somehow not perfectly set up automagically, I recommend watching this video, in 5 minutes it will explain things better than I ever could.
